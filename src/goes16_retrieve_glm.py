    Downloads and saves GOES-16 (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) data files from the Amazon S3 bucket for a specified time period.

    This function targets the 'noaa-goes16' S3 bucket, specifically accessing the GLM-L2-LCFA (Geostationary Lightning Mapper - Level 2 Lightning Detection) dataset. 
    It downloads data for every day between the initial and final years specified, covering all hours of each day.

    The data is organized in a multiband format and follows the structure: <Product>/<Year>/<Day of Year>/<Hour>/<Filename>.

    Args:
        initial_year (int): The initial year of the time period for which data is to be downloaded. The data for this year starts from January 1st.
        final_year (int): The final year of the time period for which data is to be downloaded. The data for this year includes up to December 31st.

    Returns:
        None. The function saves the downloaded files to a specified location (not defined in this docstring).

    Note: 
    - This function requires a pre-established connection to Amazon S3 and appropriate permissions to access the 'noaa-goes16' bucket.
    - It assumes the GOES-16 data is in the correct format and available for the entire range from the initial_year to the final_year.
    - Ensure sufficient storage space and network bandwidth as the dataset might be large, especially for longer time periods.
    - The function handles data for 24 hours each day, using a 0-23 hour format.
